### Senior iOS Engineer | [Curve](https://www.curve.com)
*2022-07 - Present*

Upon moving to the position of Senior iOS engineer, I had the chance to step up in 2 directions, both horizontal (within the iOS domain), and vertically (within Curve engineering). I was able to be part of some very ambitious projects, and also had the chance to be a Technical lead for a few. Not only that, but also, had the chance to work in some very specific situations with some Go micro services, typescript GraphQL orchestrators, and Ruby.

For over two and half years, I was working at Curve as contractor from Mindera. During these early years of my journey through Curve, I mainly worked a mixture of Objective-C and Swift, close to a 50/50 split, where I had the chance to work on a few already existing Curve features, back in the day, and to develop a few new ones, such the section of the app for Settings & User Account. I also had the chance of working on re-ordering the Onboarding which was written in Objective-C back then.

*2018-09 - 2019-02*

Pixelmatters was my first professional experience. During my 6 months at Pixelmatters, I had the chance to work on an iOS app that started being developed just a couple of months before I joined. I had the chance to work really closely with amazing designers, and the product level was pixel-perfect, meaning that mobile engineers were always demanded high standards from UI/UX point of view. Apart from that project, I was also involved in creating a boilerplate for iOS projects, and had a chance to write a [Medium article about Pixelmatters iOS Development toolkit](https://www.pixelmatters.com/blog/pixelmatters-ios-development-toolkit).
