# Tiago Bastos  
### Senior iOS Engineer  

Senior iOS Engineer focused in building robust, scalable mobile applications using Swift, SwiftUI, and The Composable Architecture.

While my main expertise is in iOS development, I've also worked with other technologies like Kotlin & Java (Android), as well as Go, Ruby, and TypeScript. I actively seek opportunities to contribute across different parts of the stack.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about sports, travel, and reading books about software engineering or finance.

## üéì Education


### Universidade de Aveiro
**Master's Degree in Computers and Telematics Engineering** *(2013-09 - 2018-07)*


- **Key courses:** Mobile Computing, Security, Distributed Systems, Operative Systems, Computer Architecture, Objected Oriented Programming



## üî® Skillset / Toolset


- **Swift & Objective-C**: Swift has been my daily driver language since late 2018, however, from my experience in Curve I can easily read/write code in Objective-C.

- **SwiftUI & UIkit**: Equally proficient in SwiftUI and UIKit, with a preference for SwiftUI in recent projects.. Early in my career I was focused on building UI programatically in UIKit, and, by the end of 2022 I started to focus more on SwiftUI.

- **The Composable Architecture (TCA) & MVVM**: All the projects I contributed to my career were either following TCA or MVVM. Since starting to work in SwiftUI, I've focused a lot on TCA and I keep up to date with Pointfree's content, however, I also have strong knowledge of MVVM from the times I worked in UIKit.

- **Tuist**: Curve iOS project is set up using Tuist toolchain. This experience allowed me to become proficient in working with Tuist.

- **Firebase, Embrace,**: Experienced with Firebase and Embrace for debugging, reporting, monitoring, and remote configuration. These tools have enabled me to resolve complex bugs, set up feature alerts, and gather metrics for product feedback..

- **Combine, RxSwift & ReactiveSwift**: In some of the iOS apps I contributed to, I had the chance to use these Reactive programming frameworks. I used such frameworks to perform and handle network requests/responses, drive data from View Models to the UI layer, and, handle complex business logic.

- **Swift Concurrency**: In Curve we were early adopters of Swift Concurrency, where I had the chance to work with Actors for some internal services of the iOS app, and user other tools such as AsyncStreams/AsynSequences, and, get other benefits from asynchronous programming.

- **Stripe, PayPal/Braintree**: Integration of the PayPal/Braintree iOS SDK into the Curve iOS app, to allow PayPal accounts to be used as a Funding Source in Curve. Maintenance of the Stripe SDK in the Curve App for Subscription payment collection.

- **Snowplow, Branch, Braze, Kustomer, Zendesk**: Examples of tools I helped integrating or maintaining in the Curve app for core foundational features such as: Analytuics tracking, Referrals, CRM and Customer Support.

- **Java & Kotlin (Android development)**: Throughout my University Master thesis, I had the chance to develop 2 Android apps using Kotlin & Java. I also developed some personal and University course projects in Kotlin when the language was still in its early days.

- **Ruby & Fastlane**: Maintenance of the fastlane setup in the Curve iOS App, and, also used Ruby for personal projects.

- **Go**: Basic proficiency in Go, having contributed to backend services with minor tasks to support the team.

- **TypeScript**: Basic proficiency in TypeScript, where I had the chance to work on some GraphQL Orchestrator resolvers, and, create mocks to be returned as part of GraphQL stubbed responses.
